DNSRED
======

DNSRED redirects DNS queries to other UDP/TCP DNS servers.
The following examples show how it can be used:

Redirect DNS packets to 4.2.2.4:
$ dnsred 4.2.2.4

Redirect DNS packets as TCP DNS requests to port 53 of 4.2.2.4:
$ dnsred -t 4.2.2.4

Redirect DNS packets to port 1053 of the same machine:
$ dnsred 127.0.0.1 1053
